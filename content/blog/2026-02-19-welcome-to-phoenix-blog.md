## Hello, world

Welcome to the Phoenix blog. This is where we'll share development updates,
technical deep dives, and the occasional strong opinion about game dev tooling.

### What to expect

- **Daily engine updates** — automated posts summarizing commits, merged PRs,
  and issue activity from the
  [Phoenix Engine repo](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Engine).
  These are AI-generated and clearly labeled.
- **Human-written posts** — longer-form articles about architecture decisions,
  the roadmap, and why we're building Phoenix the way we are.

### About automated posts

Some posts on this blog are generated automatically by AI from public engine
activity data. They're clearly marked with an **AI-Generated** badge so you
always know what you're reading. We review them before they go live, but they
may still contain minor inaccuracies — when in doubt, follow the linked PRs
and commits for the authoritative source.

Stay tuned. We're just getting started.
