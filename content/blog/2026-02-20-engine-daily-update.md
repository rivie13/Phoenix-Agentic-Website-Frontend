## Summary

Today’s activity in the Phoenix Agentic Engine focused on a single, significant open pull request aimed at enhancing the engine's documentation and workflow infrastructure. The proposed changes introduce a new submodule for `godot-mcp-docs` alongside an automated documentation image build script. Additionally, the PR includes various workflow hygiene improvements, contributor guidance updates, and staged edits for future engine modifications. While no commits or merged PRs landed today, this work sets the stage for smoother development and onboarding processes for agent backend integration.

## What Changed

- **Documentation Submodule Addition** — A new `godot-mcp-docs` submodule is being added under `modules/ultimate_ai/external/`, pinned to commit `579a06ff79d71a53308d806a58da0b9faaa5edc7` for reproducibility.
- **Automated Docs Image Build Script** — A script (`build_docs_image.py`) was introduced to manage local builds of the documentation container (`godot-mcp-docs:local`) with SHA marker behavior for version tracking.
- **Workflow Hygiene Improvements** — Updates to contributor instructions, workflow documentation, and skill definitions, plus staged edits pending engine changes, to maintain clarity and consistency in development practices.

## Pull Requests In Progress

| PR # | Title | Author | Link | Detail |
|------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| [#8](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Engine/pull/8) | Add godot-mcp-docs submodule + workflow hygiene/docs updates | rivie13 | [View PR](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Engine/pull/8) | Integrates a pinned documentation submodule and adds a local build script, improving reproducibility and streamlining contributor workflows. |

## Why This Matters

By integrating a dedicated documentation submodule, the engine gains a stable reference point for technical guides and AI module instructions, reducing the risk of mismatches between engine features and their documentation. The automated docs image build script allows developers to rapidly rebuild and preview documentation locally, fostering quicker feedback loops. The workflow hygiene updates ensure that contributors have clear, consistent guidance, which is especially valuable for complex features like multi-agent orchestration and backend integrations.

## Looking Ahead

Once PR #8 is reviewed and merged, developers will be able to maintain and deploy documentation in a more reliable, automated fashion. This will likely be followed by actual engine-side changes referenced in the staged edits, connecting the improved docs infrastructure directly to feature releases. The next steps involve testing the build script across different environments and refining contributor instructions based on feedback from early adopters.
