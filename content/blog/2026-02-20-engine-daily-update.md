## Summary

Today’s activity in the Phoenix Agentic Engine was focused entirely on an open pull request that is bringing in new documentation infrastructure and workflow improvements. While there were no commits or merged PRs, this in-progress work lays the foundation for better contributor guidance and smoother documentation builds. The changes are being staged on the `feature/agent-backend-integration` branch, indicating they are part of a larger integration effort around the engine’s AI modules.

## What Changed

- Introduced the `godot-mcp-docs` submodule to the engine, enabling external documentation to be versioned and built within the engine repository.
- Added a Python script (`build_docs_image.py`) for local management of documentation images, including SHA marker behavior to track build states.
- Updated contributor instructions, workflow hygiene, and skill documentation — these updates are staged for pending engine edits and will improve onboarding and consistency.

### Open PRs

1. **[#8 — Add godot-mcp-docs submodule + workflow hygiene/docs updates](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Engine/pull/8)** by `rivie13`  
   *Branch:* `mcp-docs/pr0-submodule` → `feature/agent-backend-integration`  
   This PR adds the `godot-mcp-docs` submodule pinned to commit `579a06ff79d71a53308d806a58da0b9faaa5edc7` and a build script for managing local docs images. It also revises contributor guidance, workflow practices, and skill documentation, with changes staged for future engine edits. These improvements will streamline documentation builds, ensure reproducibility, and make contributor onboarding more straightforward.

## Why This Matters

Documentation infrastructure is a critical part of maintaining a complex engine like Phoenix Agentic Engine. By integrating an external `godot-mcp-docs` submodule, the project can keep its AI tooling documentation versioned alongside the engine code, ensuring that changes in features are matched with accurate, up-to-date docs. The build script adds a reproducible process for local documentation image creation, reducing the risk of mismatched assets and improving developer confidence during build and release cycles. Workflow hygiene updates mean new contributors will have clearer guidelines and fewer obstacles when getting started.

## Looking Ahead

Once PR #8 is reviewed and merged, contributors will have a more robust and maintainable documentation workflow. The submodule integration will likely pave the way for automated documentation builds in CI, ensuring that docs remain in sync with code changes. The staged workflow and instruction updates suggest there may be further refinements to the engine’s onboarding process and internal documentation in the coming days.
