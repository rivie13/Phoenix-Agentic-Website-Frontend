## Summary

Today's activity in the Phoenix Agentic Engine was quiet on the commit side, with no new changes pushed to any branches. Development focus remains on documentation and workflow improvements, as reflected in an open pull request adding a new submodule and refining project processes.

## What Changed

- No commits were recorded across any branches.
- Continued work is visible in an open PR to integrate the `godot-mcp-docs` submodule and improve workflow hygiene and related documentation.

## Pull Requests In Progress

- [#8](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Engine/pull/8) — **Add godot-mcp-docs submodule + workflow hygiene/docs updates** by `rivie13`  
  This PR introduces a new documentation submodule for MCP and aligns workflows with updated project standards.

## Looking Ahead

Once PR #8 is merged, the engine will have a dedicated documentation submodule for MCP and cleaner workflows, which should make future feature development and maintenance more efficient.
