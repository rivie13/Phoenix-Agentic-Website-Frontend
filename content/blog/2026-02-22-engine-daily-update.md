## Summary

Today saw significant progress across both the Phoenix-Agentic Website Frontend and Engine Interface repositories, with multiple merged commits introducing refined Copilot assignment logic, signal label management improvements, and enhanced branch resolution workflows. The frontend benefited from UX polish for its pre-alpha launch, while the interface gained normalized signal label processing and upgraded field mapping mechanisms. Additionally, work is underway on a GitHub Actions deployment workflow for Azure App Service, designed to trigger only after successful CI runs. A bug was also logged in the engine regarding stalled tool result posting in chat assistant loops.

## Pull Requests In Progress

- **Phoenix-Agentic-Website-Frontend**
  - [#34](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Website-Frontend/pull/34) — *feat: GitHub Actions deployment workflow for Azure App Service* (draft, by Copilot). This introduces a `workflow_run` trigger for deployment, ensuring only CI-validated commits on `main` are deployed, enabling safe rollback and preventing coupling with CI steps.

## Issues Updated

- **Phoenix-Agentic-Engine**
  - [#25](https://github.com/rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Engine/issues/25) — *Bug: Chat assistant does not POST tool results, causing continuation loop to stall* — Open. This defect impacts conversational continuity and tool integration reliability.

## Why This Matters

The Copilot assignment and branch resolution enhancements improve automation accuracy, reducing the risk of deploying or merging from unvalidated states. Signal label management updates across frontend and interface will help ensure that data flows remain consistent and interpretable, which is critical for debugging and maintaining complex workflows. The in-progress Azure deployment workflow represents a key step towards continuous delivery with strong safeguards, making production updates safer and more predictable. Meanwhile, the newly filed engine bug highlights an area needing attention to maintain seamless assistant interactions.

## Looking Ahead

Next steps will likely focus on completing and testing the Azure deployment workflow, ensuring it integrates smoothly into the CI/CD pipeline. Addressing the chat assistant bug in the engine should be prioritized to restore uninterrupted tool-assisted conversations. With pre-alpha site UX polish in place, the frontend is well-positioned for initial user testing, while interface improvements lay the groundwork for more robust cross-component communication.
