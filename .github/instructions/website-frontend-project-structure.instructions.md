## Key boundaries

- Public frontend only: no secrets or private backend internals.
- Sensitive operations are delegated to private website backend APIs.
- Existing Phoenix agent backend remains a separate service boundary.

## Blog content system

- Blog posts live in `content/blog/*.md` with YAML front matter.
- See `src/types/blog.ts` for the `PostMeta` and `Post` types.
- See `src/lib/blog.ts` for `getAllPosts()`, `getAllSlugs()`, `getPostBySlug()`.
- AI-generated posts have `aiGenerated: true` in front matter and show a badge + disclaimer on the site.
- Human posts use `aiGenerated: false` (or omit the field). Both types coexist in the same directory.
- Hero images live in `public/images/blog/<slug>.png`.
- See `docs/AUTOMATED_BLOG_PLAN.md` for the full automation design and toggle reference.
