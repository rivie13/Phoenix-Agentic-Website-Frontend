# Focus — Phoenix Agentic Website Frontend

## Mandatory first step

Always read the current task file before doing anything else:

```
read_file(".github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md")
```

## Workflows

### Resume (user says "resume", "what am I working on?", or starts a new session)

1. Read `.github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md`
2. If a task is active: summarize the current task in 3 lines — what, last checkpoint, next step
3. If no active task: say "No active task" and offer to pick the next one

### Pick next task (user says "pick next task", "what should I work on?")

1. Read `.github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md` — confirm no active task (or ask to close current one first)
2. Read the roadmap docs:
   - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - `.github/instructions/website-frontend-roadmap.instructions.md`
3. Check the project board for items in "Ready" or "Backlog" for this repo using GitHub MCP tools:
   - `mcp_github_github_list_issues` for `rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Website-Frontend`
4. Recommend the highest-priority unblocked task based on: phase order, dependencies resolved, roadmap sequence
5. Ask user to confirm
6. Create a GitHub issue if one doesn't exist
7. Fill in `.github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md` with the task details
8. Move the issue to "In Progress" on the project board

### Update checkpoint (user says "save progress", "checkpoint", "update task")

1. Read `.github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md`
2. Ask what was accomplished and what's next
3. Update the "Last checkpoint" and "Next step" fields
4. Commit the updated CURRENT_TASK.md

### Complete task (user says "task done", "finished", "close task")

1. Read `.github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md`
2. Verify acceptance criteria are met
3. Move the issue to "Done" on the project board (or "In Review" if PR is open)
4. Reset `.github/context/CURRENT_TASK.md` to the "no active task" state
5. Commit the reset
6. Offer to pick the next task

### Assign to Copilot cloud agent (user says "assign to copilot", "cloud agent this")

1. Confirm the issue is well-scoped with clear acceptance criteria
2. Add the `cloud-agent` label to the issue
3. The `cloud-agent-assign.yml` workflow will auto-assign Copilot
4. Set "Work mode" to "Cloud Agent" on the project board
5. Move board item to "Ready" if not already there
6. Note in CURRENT_TASK.md that this task is delegated to cloud agent

## Issue hierarchy

Use sub-issues for structured work. See `.github/docs/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` for full details.

- **Epic** (label: `epic`) — Multi-repo milestone, spans weeks–months
- **Feature** (label: `feature`) — Single-repo deliverable, days–weeks
- **Task** (label: `task`) — Single PR unit of work, hours–days

Sub-issues can cross repos. A Frontend Feature can be a sub-issue of a cross-repo Epic.

## Cross-repo awareness

This is the **Website Frontend** repo (public Next.js site). Related repos:
- Website Backend: `rivie13/Phoenix-Agentic-Website-Backend`

The frontend communicates with the website backend via API. Changes to API contracts may affect both repos.

## Project board

- **Board URL:** https://github.com/users/rivie13/projects/3
- **Columns:** Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done

## Reference docs

- **Full workflow:** `.github/docs/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` — Ralph Loop, issue hierarchy, cloud agent flow
- **Roadmap:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
